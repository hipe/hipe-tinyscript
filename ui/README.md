# Hipe Tinyscript Ui

## abstract

Experiments in graphical user interface generation.


## description

This is a totally ridiculous experimental extension to hipe-tinyscript that allows you to generate a graphical user interface (gui) dynamically for a tinyscript app.

Its focus will be on determining an abstract representation of the interface of an application written for one modality, and taking that and generating interfaces in other modalities for the same application.

If this works at all, it may or may not be moved to its own repository, because it is a wholly separate concern from the core scope of Hipe::Tinyscript
